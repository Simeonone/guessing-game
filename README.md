# Guessing Game
This is a website where a user chooses any number between 1 and 12, then clicks on next where there will be 12 cards randomly shuffled.

It uses the JavaScript's DOM functionality, and random number generation for shuffling the cards.

The user then chooses which of the 12 cards has the number initially input

The user can select on the **hint** button to get a hint on what card color the number initially input has been randomly placed in.

In addition, the user can click on the **Show Box Numbers** button to reveal the hidden numbers
